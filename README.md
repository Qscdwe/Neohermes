# Neohermes

Your machine should have mpi, mpi4py, cmake, python3
It should also have these python packages: gym, numpy, baselines, pandas, gym_token.

It must have baselines version 0.1.5, which is required to be installed by cloning from https://github.com/openai/baselines and running pip install -e .

The baselines version 0.1.5 but install not by cloning from github will not work (the checkpoint_path parameter will not be available).
